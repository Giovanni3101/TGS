    description:
      "It all started with a conversation. In 2022, during an informal exchange between Kyamoneka Benjamin, a law student, and Nonso Alan, a data science student, a clear reality emerged: thousands of talented individuals across the Global South possess immense potential, yet remain excluded from global opportunities due to limited access to information, guidance, and networks. This discussion marked the birth of a simple but ambitious idea — to create a bridge between talent and opportunity.",

    title: "From Idea to Initiative",
    description:
      "The idea gradually took shape and became The Growth Sphere (TGS). At this stage, TGS was not yet a formal organization, but rather an initiative driven by a clear mission: to make academic, professional, and technological opportunities accessible to people from the Global South. Early efforts focused on identifying scholarships, conferences, programs, and job opportunities, centralizing them, and sharing them with a growing and engaged community.",

    title: "Building Support and Trust",
    description:
      "Over time, one reality became evident — access to information alone was not enough. Many beneficiaries expressed the need for personalized guidance, application support, strategic advice, and a reassuring framework to help them move forward with confidence. In response, The Growth Sphere expanded its mission by offering optional mentorship, academic and career orientation, and practical support adapted to local realities. TGS began to position itself not only as an opportunity hub, but as a trusted partner along each individual’s journey.",
